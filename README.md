# Background Context

This project serves as a Test Driven Development (TDD) Sandbox, created as part of a TDD training program led by [Valentina JemuoviÄ‡](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valentinajemuovic) through [Optivem Journal](https://journal.optivem.com/). In this environment, we are simulating legacy code to practice and implement TDD transformation techniques, which will prepare us to apply these methods to real-world projects. We selected a desktop application for this project to align closely with the types of applications our company produces and to ensure relevance to real-life scenarios.

# Use cases for the Simple Electron MongoDB Query Tool:

1. **Running MongoDB Queries**: Users can input and execute MongoDB `find` queries, enabling them to retrieve specific data from the MongoDB database.

2. **Viewing Results in JSON Format**: After executing a query, users can view the results in a structured JSON format, making it easy to read and understand the data returned.

3. **Configuring MongoDB Connection**: The application utilizes the MongoDB URI, Database, and Collection specified in the settings while running queries. This approach allows users to easily configure their connection details without needing to input connection strings each time they execute a query.

4. **Overviewing Execution History**: Users can invoke an "Advanced View" feature to see a simplified history of their queries and replies.
5. **Persisting Query History**: Users can have their previous queries saved in local storage, allowing them to easily access and rerun past queries without retyping.

6. **Managing Settings and Theme**: The application includes a settings menu that allows users to switch themes and MongoDB URI/Database/Collection. Settings are persisted in local storage in order to facilitate users not to enter them each time after the app has been restarted. Settings have default values, which are used when the app starts for the first time, and lately can be replaced anytime.
7. **Checking for Application Updates**: The tool incorporates functionality to check for the latest application version through the GitHub API, ensuring that users can easily stay updated with the newest features and improvements.

# External System(s)

**OS System theme**: The application retrieves the system theme setting from the operating system (OS) to apply the appropriate theme based on the user's preferred color scheme, which is determined by whether the OS is set to light or dark mode.

**GitHub API**: Employed to manage and access version release information via the GitHub REST API, enabling the application to check for the latest available updates and ensure users are running the most recent version.

# Systems which App interacts with

**MongoDB**: The primary database system used for managing and querying data. MongoDB facilitates the storage of JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas, which is integral to the query tool's operation. [MongoDB Documentation](https://mongodb.com/docs/)

**SQLite**: Local database for local storage

# System Architecture Style

The Simple Electron MongoDB Query Tool employs a **Monolithic Architecture Style**, combining both frontend and backend functionalities within a single application. This approach simplifies development and deployment, enabling users to execute MongoDB queries directly from the Electron interface without requiring a separate server.

# Repository and Branching Strategy

This project is hosted on GitHub, with source code managed and integrated with a CI/CD pipeline for automated build and testing.
We have mono github repo for the whole project. We create PRs and merge them to master branch from our personal repos or our branches from current repo.

# Deployment Model

The Simple Electron MongoDB Query Tool can be deployed as a native desktop application across various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Leveraging ElectronJS capabilities, the app can package web technologies into standalone executables, allowing users to easily install and run the application on their local machines without needing an additional server setup. This ensures a seamless experience for users while maintaining consistent functionality across platforms.

## How to Install the Application from .dmg installer

1. **Download** the `.dmg` from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/vaisakhsasikumar/my-electron-app/releases/latest).
2. **Open Terminal** and navigate to the download location:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads
   ```
3. **Run** the command to remove security attributes:
   ```bash
   xattr -c "MongoDB-Query-Executor-Mac-x.x.x-Installer.dmg"
   ```
4. **Mount** the `.dmg` by double-clicking it.
5. **Drag** the app to your `Applications` folder.
6. **Launch** the application from `Applications`.

### **Important Note**

- **Installer Signing:** Currently, the installer is **not signed**, which is why it is needed to run the `xattr -c` command.

## Steps to Run the Application (from source code)

1. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install

   ```

2. **Build, Run and Deploy**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run dev
   ```
