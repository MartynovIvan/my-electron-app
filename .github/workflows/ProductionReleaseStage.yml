# Production Release Stage Workflow
#
# - **Triggers:** Initiates manually via workflow dispatch with inputs for tag name and run ID.
#
# - **Inputs:**
#   - `tag_name`: The tag name for the release (e.g., v1.0.0).
#   - `run_id`: The ID of the workflow run where the desired download artifact was uploaded from.
#
# - **Permissions:** Requires write-all permission for executing tasks.
#
# - **Jobs:**
#   - **Production Release Stage:**
#     - **Environment:** Uses `macos-latest` and requires a GitHub token.
#     - **Key Steps:**
#       - **Checkout Test Repository:** Retrieves code from the test repository.
#       - **Download Artifact:** Downloads the build artifact from a specified run ID.
#       - **Set Permissions:** Adjusts permissions for scripts to ensure executability.
#       - **Run Automated Installation:** Executes installation scripts.
#       - **Dependency Handling:** Installs necessary node modules.
#       - **Smoke Tests Execution:** Runs basic tests to ensure application stability.
#       - **Git Tag Verification:** Confirms the non-existence of the Git tag to prevent duplicates.
#       - **Release Management:** Creates or updates a release based on tag existence.
#       - **Artifact Handling:**
#         - Finds `.dmg` file for the release.
#         - Uploads `.dmg` to the GitHub release using the `gh` CLI.
#       - **Confirmation:** Prints a message confirming successful release creation and upload.
#
# This workflow facilitates the creation and publication of software releases, ensuring that the release process is automated, reliable, and easy to execute.
